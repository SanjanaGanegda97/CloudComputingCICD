# **HealthSync - MediTrack**

HealthSync is a microservices-based health-tech solution designed for MediTrack to manage patient health records, streamline medical appointments, and provide insights through data aggregation and reporting. The solution is built with scalability, security, and affordability in mind, leveraging Kubernetes, AWS, and CI/CD pipelines.

---

## **Features**

- **Microservices Architecture**:
  - Patient Record Service
  - Appointment Scheduling Service
  - Notification Service
  - Aggregator Service
- **Data Aggregation & Reporting**:
  - Insights like appointments per doctor and common conditions treated.
  - AWS Redshift for data storage and AWS QuickSight for dashboards.
- **Observability**:
  - Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and logging.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - Automated build, test, and deployment using GitHub Actions and Jenkins.
- **Scalability**:
  - Kubernetes-managed services with load balancing and autoscaling.

---

## **Architecture**

The platform is designed with the following components:

- **Kubernetes**: Manages service deployments and scaling.
- **AWS**:
  - **Redshift**: Stores aggregated metrics for analytics.
  - **QuickSight**: Visualizes metrics with interactive dashboards.
  - **S3**: Stores raw data for processing.
- **Observability**:
  - **Prometheus**: Monitors service health and performance.
  - **Grafana**: Displays service metrics and logs.

## **Setup and Deployment**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- Docker installed locally.
- Kubernetes cluster (Minikube, AWS EKS, GKE, etc.).
- AWS account with S3, Redshift, and QuickSight access.
- Tools: `kubectl`, `helm`, and `pytest`.

### **2. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/HealthSync.git
cd HealthSync
```

### **3. Build Docker Images**
Run the following for each microservice:
```bash
docker build -t <service-name> ./<service-directory>
```

### **4. Deploy to Kubernetes**
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployments/
kubectl apply -f k8s/services/
```

### **5. Configure Observability**
- Deploy Prometheus and Grafana using Helm.
- Import the Grafana dashboard from `observability/grafana/dashboards.json`.

### **6. Setup AWS**
- Run Redshift scripts in `aws/redshift/`.
- Import the QuickSight dashboard from `aws/quicksight/dashboard_template.json`.

---

## **Testing**

### **1. Integration Tests**
Run the integration tests:
```bash
pytest tests/integration/
```

### **2. Load Test**
Execute the JMeter test plan:
```bash
jmeter -n -t tests/load/load_test.jmx -l results.jtl
```
